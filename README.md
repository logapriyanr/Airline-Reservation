Airline reservation System is a programmed system which is used
to store and retrieve information and conduct transactions related
to air travel. The project aims to design an Airline Reservation
System application which enables the customers to search and
book flight .

After searching, the system displays a list of available flights and
allows customers to choose a particular flight. To book a flight the
system asks the customer to enter his details such as name, age,
contact number etc and allows the customer to book the flight and
update the airline database and user database.

The system also allows the customer to cancel his/her reservation,
if any problem occurs. The main purpose of this software is to
reduce the manual errors involved in the airline reservation
process and make it convenient for the customers to book the
flights as when they require such that they can utilize this software
to make reservations, modify reservations or cancel a particular
reservation.
